# DESIGN.md — Canonical Geometry

This document is the single source of truth for the Fax Machine Box geometry.
`src/faxbox/config.py` implements these numbers; `tests/test_assembly_fit.py`
enforces the relationships. If code disagrees with this document, the code is
wrong. If this document seems wrong, comment on issue #15 — do not silently
change numbers.

Everything is in **millimeters**. Material is uniform **3.175mm (1/8") plywood**
(`T` below). Laser kerf is handled by Boxes.py's `burn` parameter (0.08mm
starting value — calibrate with a test cut before the real run).

## Decisions this design implements (Ben, 2026-07-07)

- Drawers open from the **rear** 6.5"×5" end face (SPEC "Rear Drawer Housing").
- **"FAX MACHINE"** pixel-font engraving on the **right side wall** exterior.
- **Fixed top panel** over the drawer bay (not a removable lid).
- Sliding lid rides in **through-slots** cut through both side walls, open at
  the front edge; lid inserts from the front. Slot ends visible outside = accepted.
- Target service: NYC Resistor; blue `#0000FF` = cut, red `#FF0000` = engrave.

## Coordinate convention

Origin at the box's **exterior front-left-bottom corner**.

- **X**: length, 0 at front face → 304.8 at rear face (12")
- **Y**: width, 0 at left face → 165.1 at right face (6.5")
- **Z**: height, 0 at underside → 127.0 at top (5")

"Front" = the paper-compartment end. "Rear" = the drawer end.

## Global derived values

| Quantity | Value | Derivation |
|---|---|---|
| `T` material thickness | 3.175 | 1/8" ply |
| Interior length `L_INT` | 298.45 | 304.8 − 2T |
| Interior width `W_INT` | 158.75 | 165.1 − 2T |
| Wall base plane | Z = 0 | walls run full height; bottom panel inset between them |
| Interior floor top | Z = 3.175 | top surface of the inset bottom panel |
| Full wall height | 127.0 | exterior height |
| Sliding clearance | ≥ 1.5 | SPEC: min 1/16" on sliding interfaces |
| Faceplate reveal | 0.75/side | flush faceplate gap in its opening |

> **Amendment (2026-07-07, issue #17 prep):** the first revision stood the
> walls on top of a full-footprint bottom panel. That construction makes the
> rear wall's sill-free openings open-bottomed (no material below them —
> fragile free-standing legs). Current revision: full-height walls with the
> bottom panel inset between them (standard finger-box construction), giving
> a solid T-thick web under the bottom openings. All interior numbers are
> unchanged.

## Longitudinal layout (X axis)

| Region | X span | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Front wall | 0 → 3.175 | T |
| Paper compartment (interior) | 3.175 → 79.375 | 76.2 (3") |
| Vertical divider | 79.375 → 82.55 | T |
| Drawer bay (interior) | 82.55 → 301.625 | **219.075** |
| Rear wall | 301.625 → 304.8 | T |

## Vertical layout (Z axis)

| Feature | Z span | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bottom panel | 0 → 3.175 | inset between the walls |
| Front wall top edge | 118.025 | = lid slot bottom; lid slides over it |
| Lid slot (through side walls) | 118.025 → 122.0 | height 3.975 = T + 0.8 |
| Side-wall rail above slot | 122.0 → 127.0 | 5.0 tall, spans slot X range |
| Divider top edge | 123.825 | = top panel underside |
| Top panel (over bay) | 123.825 → 127.0 | fixed, finger-jointed |
| Bay interior height | 3.175 → 123.825 | 120.65 |
| Bottom drawer slot | 3.175 → 61.9125 | clear height 58.7375 |
| Horizontal shelf | 61.9125 → 65.0875 | T thick |
| Top drawer slot | 65.0875 → 123.825 | clear height 58.7375 |

**Lid slot vertical clearance is 0.8mm (not the SPEC's 1.5mm).** Deliberate
deviation: the SPEC's 1.5mm play is applied in the sliding *plane* (lid width,
drawer fits). Across the lid's thickness, 1.5mm would rattle; 0.8mm still
absorbs plywood thickness variation (+0.2 typical). Recorded here so tests can
assert 0.8 without someone "fixing" it back.

## Parts list

Nominal dimensions below are **interior-face spans**; finger joints extend a
part up to T beyond nominal on each jointed edge (Boxes.py handles this). The
SVG harness (#16) checks each part's bounding box is within
[nominal, nominal + 2T] per axis according to its jointed edges.

### 1. Bottom panel — 1×

- Nominal: **298.45 (X) × 158.75 (Y)**, inset between the walls at Z = 0 →
  3.175 (bottom face flush with the wall bottom edges). Edge fingers extend
  into hole lines cut through the four walls near their bottom edges
  (hole-line midplane at Z = 1.5875).
- Through-hole line for the divider's bottom-edge fingers at X = 79.375 →
  82.55 (midplane X = 80.9625).

### 2. Side walls — 2× (left Y=0→3.175, right Y=161.925→165.1)

**The two side walls are mirror images, not identical parts** — the lid slot
sits at the front only, so a single cut pattern cannot serve both sides.
Convention: draw both with the **exterior face up**; the left wall's features
are the right wall's mirrored in X. Engraving goes on the right wall only.

- Nominal: **298.45 (X) × 127.0 (Z)**, full height.
- Vertical edges: finger joints to front wall (only up to Z=118.025 on the
  front edge — above that is the lid slot mouth and rail end, plain) and rear
  wall (full height).
- Bottom edge: straight, with a through-hole line just above it (midplane
  Z = 1.5875) receiving the bottom panel's edge fingers.
- Top edge: plain over the paper compartment/rail; finger-jointed to the top
  panel over the bay (X = 82.55 → 301.625).
- **Lid through-slot**: X = 3.175 → 79.375 within the wall, **open at the
  wall's front edge** (the lid could never be inserted otherwise),
  Z = 118.025 → 122.0. Construction: drawn as a closed rectangular hole whose
  front boundary exactly coincides with the blank's front edge — the laser
  cuts both lines and the mouth opens (one 3.975mm segment double-cut;
  negligible). Leaves a 5.0mm rail above (Z 122 → 127) cantilevered from
  X = 79.375 — handle gently until assembled.
- **Divider finger-hole line**: vertical, X = 79.375 → 82.55, Z = 3.175 →
  123.825. (A Boxes.py `fingerHolesAt` line — a dashed row of T-wide holes,
  not one continuous slot.)
- **Shelf finger-hole line**: horizontal, Z = 61.9125 → 65.0875, X = 82.55 →
  301.625. (Dashed row, as above.)
- **Right wall only**: "FAX MACHINE" engraving (red), 5×7 pixel font,
  pixel size 4.0mm → text ≈ 240 × 28, centered at X = 152.4, Z = 63.5.
  Engrave on the exterior face (the drawn face, per the convention above).

### 3. Front wall — 1×

- Nominal: **158.75 (Y) × 118.025 (Z)** (Z = 0 → 118.025).
- Bottom-panel hole line near the bottom edge (midplane Z = 1.5875); vertical
  edges finger-joint to side walls; top edge plain (the lid slides over it).

### 4. Rear wall — 1×

- Nominal: **158.75 (Y) × 127.0 (Z)**, full height.
- Bottom-panel hole line near the bottom edge; sides → side walls; top edge
  → top panel.
- **Two drawer openings**, each **152.4 wide (= W_INT − 2T) × 55.0 tall**,
  centered in Y (0.875mm inside each interior corner joint; visible frame from
  outside ≈ 6.35mm per side):
  - Bottom opening: Z = 3.175 → 58.175 (sill-free: bottom edge = floor top;
    the solid web below it, Z = 0 → 3.175, is exactly the inset bottom
    panel's edge zone).
  - Top opening: Z = 65.0875 → 120.0875 (sill-free: bottom edge = shelf top).
  - Webs remaining: 3.175 below the bottom opening, 3.7375 below the shelf
    line, 3.7375 above the top opening — each ≥ 3.0; do not enlarge openings.

### 5. Vertical divider — 1×

- Nominal: **158.75 (Y) × 120.65 (Z)** (Z = 3.175 → 123.825, standing on the
  bottom panel).
- Bottom edge fingers down through the bottom panel's hole line; side edges
  finger into side-wall hole lines; top edge fingers up into top panel holes.
  Fully captive on 4 edges → carries the structural load the SPEC requires.
- Its front face (X = 79.375) is the sliding lid's end stop.

### 6. Horizontal shelf — 1×

- Nominal: **219.075 (X) × 158.75 (Y)** at Z = 61.9125 → 65.0875.
- Side edges finger into side-wall hole lines (SPEC requirement); front edge
  fingers into a hole line in the divider; rear edge plain, butting the rear
  wall's interior face.

### 7. Top panel (drawer bay) — 1×

- Nominal: **219.075 (X) × 158.75 (Y)** at Z = 123.825 → 127.
- Side and rear edges finger-joint into the side/rear wall top edges; front
  region has a finger-hole line receiving the divider's top-edge fingers, with
  the panel's plain front edge extending flush over the divider to X = 79.375
  (so its X extent is 79.375 → 301.625 = 222.25 nominal including the divider
  cover strip).

### 8. Sliding lid — 1×

- Blank: **79.0 (X) × 163.6 (Y)**, plain edges, plus a grip slot.
- Width 163.6 = 165.1 − 1.5 sliding clearance; edges engage 2.425mm into each
  side-wall through-slot (slots are through-cuts, so the slot floor is the
  full exterior width).
- Length 79.0 stops against the divider with the front edge ~0.4mm shy of the
  front face. Travel: slides in from the front, over the front wall top edge.
- Grip: rounded through-slot **30 × 10, r = 5**, centered in Y, slot center
  15mm from the front edge.

### 9. Drawers — 2× identical, 6 pieces each

Body = open-top finger-jointed box, captive bottom:

- Body external: **149.0 (Y) × 218.0 (X) × 53.5 (Z)**.
- Body interior: 142.65 × 211.65 × 50.325.
- Fit checks: passes its opening with ≥1.5mm on every edge (152.4−149.0 = 3.4
  across width; 55.0−53.5 = 1.5 in height); slides in a 58.7375 slot
  (5.24 headroom); bay length gap when closed ≈ 1.1.
- Lateral play in the bay is ~4.9mm/side by design — the drawer is guided by
  its opening, not the bay walls; max skew ≈ 1.3°, acceptable for a first cut.

Faceplate (6th piece), glued to the body front:

- Blank: **150.9 (Y) × 53.5 (Z)** = opening − 2 × 0.75 reveal; covers the body
  cross-section exactly in height, +0.95/side in width; flush with the rear
  face when closed (faceplate thickness T fills the rear wall plane).
- **Grip slot**: closed rounded slot **30 × 15, r = 7.5**, cut through BOTH
  the faceplate and the body's front wall, aligned, so a finger hooks through
  into the drawer. Centered in Y; slot top edge 8.0 below the part's top edge
  (slot spans 30.5 → 45.5 of the 53.5 height). A closed slot (not a top-edge
  notch) keeps the top edge stiff and the opening reveal continuous.
- Registration: red-engraved outline of the body cross-section on the
  faceplate's back for glue-up alignment.

## Clearance summary (what the tests enforce)

| Interface | Clearance | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Drawer body ↔ opening width | 3.4 total | ≥ 1.5 per SPEC |
| Drawer body ↔ opening height | 1.5 | ≥ 1.5 |
| Drawer body ↔ slot height | 5.24 | ≥ 1.5 |
| Drawer body ↔ bay length | ~1.1 | > 0 (not a sliding fit) |
| Lid width ↔ slot span | 1.5 total | ≥ 1.5 |
| Lid thickness ↔ slot height | 0.8 | = 0.8 (documented deviation) |
| Faceplate ↔ opening | 0.75/side | reveal 0.5–1.0 |
| Webs in rear wall | 3.175 / 3.7375 | ≥ 3.0 |

## Known deltas from SPEC.md targets

- Drawer external length 221.2 (body 218 + faceplate T) vs SPEC "9.0 external":
  the difference is consumed by the front wall, divider, and rear wall within
  the fixed 12" envelope. SPEC marks drawer dims "to fit" — envelope wins.
- Drawer external width 149.0 vs SPEC "approx 6.3" (160)": constrained by the
  rear-wall opening needing ≥T structural webs at the corners plus pass-through
  clearance. SPEC marks this "to fit".
