### **Design Specifications: The "Fax Machine" Board Game Box**

#### **Project Overview**

This is a design for a custom board game box to be laser-cut from wood. The construction should utilize tab-and-slot (finger joint) assembly. All measurements provided are **target external dimensions**. The builder/agent is responsible for adjusting internal clearances and joint offsets based on the chosen material thickness.

#### **2. Component Breakdown**

**A. Front "Paper" Compartment**

* **External Footprint:** 3.0" (L) x 6.5" (W).
* **Lid Style:** Top-entry slide-in lid.
* **Lid Dimensions:** 3.0" x 6.5" (plus rail/groove allowance).
* **Mechanism:** Side walls must feature a horizontal groove or rail at the top edge to allow the lid to slide into place from the front or back.

**B. Rear Drawer Housing**

* **External Footprint:** 9.0" (L) x 6.5" (W).
* **Configuration:** Two (2) stacked drawers.
* **Internal Divider:** A fixed horizontal shelf at the vertical midpoint (~2.5"). This shelf should be tabbed into the side walls for structural support.

**C. Internal Drawers (Quantity: 2)**

* **Length:** 9.0" (External).
* **Width:** To fit (approx. 6.3" depending on material thickness).
* **Height:** To fit (approx. 2.3" depending on shelf thickness).
* **Design:** Open-top boxes with a flush-mount faceplate.

#### **3. Technical Demands for the Builder**

* **Material:** Uniform thickness for all parts (e.g., 3mm, 5mm, or 1/4" plywood).
* **Clearance/Tolerance:**
  * Apply a minimum of 1/16" (1.5mm) of "play" for all sliding parts (drawers and top lid) to account for wood expansion and friction.
  * Calculate internal volume based on material thickness to ensure the outer 12" x 6.5" x 5" footprint remains exact.
* **Structural Integrity:** The vertical wall separating the front and rear compartments must be structural, as it supports the 12" span of the lid and base.
